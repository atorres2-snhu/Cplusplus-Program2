-The Corner Grocer Item-Tracking Program is designed to analyze a text file containing records of purchased items. The program tracks the frequency of each item and displays the result.

-What I did well on this project was that I planned out how I was going to code it and what were the requirements of the program.

-Where I could have improved this code would have been using multiple programming languages to bring mor efunctionality to the code.

-The most difficult part of the code to write was the code to open the data from the workspace.

-Ironically, being able to use information from a separate file will prove to be very useful in the future as well.

-I made sure to group each part of the code separately and created comments to organize the code for easy maintenance and readability.
